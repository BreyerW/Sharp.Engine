# ImGuiSharp AS-IS

- Currently not maintained as the code has been used in another project and heavily modified. This code is put here AS-IS for other developers to use, alter or do whatever they see fit.

[LICENSE](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/LICENSE) Will retain ImGui's license for the time being.

Near completion of most of the port for ImGui to .NET. I would say I'm around the 90% mark and I'm currently working on the demo side to finish off any pieces I missed along the way. Here are some random points of interest.
- Currently targeting MonoGame but I will remove this requirement to keep it in line with ImGui
- Ported stb_textedited, may be useful for others looking for text input logic for .NET
- Switched from stb truetype to freetype2
- ~~The screen shot below is rendering around 0.7ms in release mode (albeit on a higher end pc).~~ Now down to <= 1ms in debug mode due to passing raw imgui data straight to buffers.
- Still issues with input editing for sliders
- ~~Pixel snapping issues causing things to appear blurry~~
- ~~Minor issue with treeviews and retaining their state open properties when selecting other nodes~~
- Appears to be an issue with the scaling to the window
- ~~Code will be put up on GitHub in the near future~~
- ~~Can not build for x64 due to SharpFont nuget package hard coding to x86 binaries with a TODO statement to fix it...~~
