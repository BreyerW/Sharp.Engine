# Sharp.Engine

Barebone and open source (mostly MIT-like licensed) 3d editor based on gtk-sharp (as window/file manager) and custom GWENdotnet for editor UI that can be extended to anything else (game engine, modelling tool etc.). Very early - NOT even alpha - stage.

#List of used 3rd party libraries (all open source and MIT-like licensed)

* AssimpNet (mesh importing/exporting)
* OpenTK (graphic backend, DirectX planned)
* SharpNav (pathfinding)
* Migrant (serializer)
* custom GWENdotnet (UI, rename planned to Sharp.UI)
* gtk-sharp (window/file manager, the only LGPL licensed but used for desktop-only code)

List is incomplete, integrating physic (PhysX, Bullet, BEPUPhysic v2.0?), audio (?), networking (Lidgren?), multiplatform and performance helper (LLILC) is planned
