        //======= Crossings Multiply algorithm of InsideTest ========================

        //
        // This version is usually somewhat faster than the original published in
        // Graphics Gems IV; by turning the division for testing the X axis crossing
        // into a tricky multiplication test this part of the test became faster,
        // which had the additional effect of making the test for "both to left or
        // both to right" a bit slower for triangles than simply computing the
        // intersection each time.  The main increase is in triangle testing speed,
        // which was about 15% faster; all other polygon complexities were pretty much
        // the same as before.  On machines where division is very expensive (not the
        // case on the HP 9000 series on which I tested) this test should be much
        // faster overall than the old code.  Your mileage may (in fact, will) vary,
        // depending on the machine and the test data, but in general I believe this
        // code is both shorter and faster.  This test was inspired by unpublished
        // Graphics Gems submitted by Joseph Samosky and Mark Haigh-Hutchinson.
        // Related work by Samosky is in:

        // Samosky, Joseph, "SectionView: A system for interactively specifying and
        // visualizing sections through three-dimensional medical image data",

        // Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993.

        // Shoot a test ray along +X axis.  The strategy is to compare vertex Y values
        // to the testing point's Y and quickly discard edges which are entirely to one
        // side of the test ray.  Note that CONVEX and WINDING code can be added as
        // for the CrossingsTest() code; it is left out here for clarity.
