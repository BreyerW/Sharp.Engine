        * case means that any vertical line intersects the interior of the
        * region in a single interval.  
        *
        * Tessellation consists of adding interior edges (actually pairs of
        * half-edges), to split the region into non-overlapping triangles.
        *
        * The basic idea is explained in Preparata and Shamos (which I don''t
        * have handy right now), although their implementation is more
        * complicated than this one.  The are two edge chains, an upper chain
        * and a lower chain.  We process all vertices from both chains in order,
        * from right to left.
        *
        * The algorithm ensures that the following invariant holds after each
        * vertex is processed: the untessellated region consists of two
        * chains, where one chain (say the upper) is a single edge, and
        * the other chain is concave.  The left vertex of the single edge
        * is always to the left of all vertices in the concave chain.
        *
        * Each step consists of adding the rightmost unprocessed vertex to one
        * of the two chains, and forming a fan of triangles from the rightmost
        * of two chain endpoints.  Determining whether we can add each triangle
        * to the fan is a simple orientation test.  By making the fan as large
        * as possible, we restore the invariant (check it yourself).
